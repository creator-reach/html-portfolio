<h2>Top 5 Anime of all Bloody Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. One Piece</h3>
<p>
  This honestly has to be one of the best animes of all time, if not the
  best.<br />
  Whether it is the Plot, the Characters and their various development
  throughout the story, whether its the world , the art or the animation. Each
  and everyone of those factors have been honed to the absolute peak of media.
  It has over 1500 episodes, yet it still has the captivating power to keep one
  engaged and not get tired even after binge watching for days one end. The best
  anime I tell you, I rate it a 1000000/100.
</p>
<h3>2. Naruto</h3>
<p>
  Honestly, what else is there to say. This anime is not just a film, its a life
  lesson turned into an Epic story of how an enstranged boy bereaved of all his
  loved ones and outcasted by his entire village goes from being a notorious
  trouble maker to one of the most respected and powerful individuals on his
  planet.
</p>
<h3>3. Gintama</h3>
<p>
  No More questions need to be brought forward for this anime. It is by far,
  historically and evidently the most funny anime in existence. But dont let the
  laughs and giggles distract you from the engaging storyline of how a lost
  ronin, an alien withe her dog and a samurai trainee work together to unravel
  the deeper mysteries plaguimng the current state of their country.
</p>
<h3>4. Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>
  This anime was the turning point of all anime in the current century gaining
  worldwide attraction. It managed to use its deep engaging plot to attract new
  believers into the anime cult. One of the best animes of all time.
</p>
<h3>5. Dororo</h3>
<p>Absolute Cinema. Peak writing.</p>
