<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Agulanna Chidire Joel, and I have a vision.</p>

<p>Its not a big one like those you hear in ispirational books or motivation speeches, its quite simple but it means the whole world to me.
  I dream of having a fulfilled life with my beautiful wife who is exquisitely known as Mmesomma PraiseGod Chibuoke, and building a future, a home, a family with her.
</p>

<p>As at the time im writing this, I should be 22 about to clock 23 and im still at the lowest point in my life financially wise.
  Im working towards a brighter future where my vision can be achieved and I want to be a living testament that showcases how this ordeal, course, curriculum or whatever you want to call it, on this web dev lessons change my life for the better.
  Join me and watch me grow into a better me. Thank you
